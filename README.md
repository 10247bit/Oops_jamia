Oops Lab Program Fifth Semester-2017

Question-1 :- Write a C++ program to find the number of vowels present in the given character array using pointer arithmetic.

Question-2 :- Write a C++ prorgam to print the given number in reverse order.Use Functions with return type and without return type for reversing the number.

Question-3 :- Write a C++ prorgam to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition,substraction,division,modulus and multiplication using inline function.

Question-4 :- Create a class for counting the number of objects created and destroyed within various block using constructor and destructors.

Question-5 :- Write a C++ program to create three objects for a class named pntr_obj with data members such as roll_no and name.Create a member function set_data() for setting the data values and print() member function to print which objects has invoked it using 'this' pointer.

Question-6 :- Write a C++ program ti implement virtual function by creating a base class c_polygon which has a virtual function area().Two classes c_rectangle and c_triangle derived from the c_polygon and they have area() to calculate and return the local area.

Question-7 :- Write a C++ program to count the number of persons inside a bank, by increasing count whenever a person enters a bank,using an increament operator overloading function and decreases the count whenever a person leaves the bank using a decrement operator overloading function inside a class;

Question-8 :- Write a c++ program to create teo objects of a class called company and add their data members using an operator overloaded function for '+' operator and '-' operator.

Question-9 :- Write a C++ prorgam to create a class matrix and overload +,- operator to perform matrix addition and substraction.

Question-10 :- Write a program to accept five different number by creating a class friendfunc1 and friendfunc2 taking 2 and 3 args respectively and calculate the average of the these numbers by passing objects of the classes to friend function/

Question-11 :- Write a program to accept the student details such as name and 3 different marks by get_data() method and display the name and average of marks using display() method.Define a friend class for calculating the average of marks using the method mark_avg().

Question-12 :- Write a program that uses a function template called min to determine the smaller of two arguments.The program should work for integers,characters and floating-point as arguments to this function.

Question-13 :- Write a program to explain class template by creating a template T for a class named pair having two data members of type T which are inputted by a constructor and a member function get_max() return the greatest of two numbers to main.Note: the values of T depends upon the datatype specified during object creation.

Question-14 :- Write a program in C++ to overload cin and cout stream operator to input and display objects of class student which contains student details like name,rollno,class,age.

Question-15 :- Write a class 3D which inherits another class 2D for a 3 dimensional calculations.Using these classes define any 2 points in a 3D space and find the distance between them.

Question-16 :- Write a program in java to implement a calculator having addition and substraction operations along with the concept of memory(M+).

Question-17 :- Write a program in c++ that acts as a Contact Manager.It saves the content to a file and retrieves them asked when asked by the user.Modules of the program include : Add,Delete,Search,Display
